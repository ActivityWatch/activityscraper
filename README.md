ActivityScraper
===============

*Scrape everything, leave nothing behind.*

## About

Alternative names: *Replaymember*, *Selfpast*

If ActivityScraper is given audio and video recordings, it can annotate them and provide playback of them. We can combine this with ActivityWatch and that **enables annotated recordings of all computer activity**. Using this we can build a complete story of what happened. 

But perhaps more amazingly: we could train ML/AI with the data (since it's labeled) to auto-annotate (using image classifiers and deep learning).

This is an application enabled by ActivityWatch.


## Issues

 - Storage
   - Lowering resolution and quality (the most basic solution)
   - Can be mediated using a high compression rate (but not an option since it needs to be real-time and energy efficient)
 - Work
   - When is the right time? Probably not a good time for quite a while, but cool stuff.

## PoC

 - Doesn't do recording itself
 - Just annotates given screen and/or audio recordings.
 - Makes those recordings browsable/viewable in some rudimentary fashion

## Future

 - Nice playback of the recordings
 - Might be able to do recording itself if nice libraries are available
 - Try to build auto-annotators using AI/ML (sounds like a possible task for deep learning)

## Uses

 - Archive and label playing using annotations (would work against such horrors as WebDRM)
   - You would have a searchable copy of every bit of video and audio you played on your computer.

## Far Future

 - Maybe it could even understand VR content one day.
